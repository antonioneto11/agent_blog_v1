Custom Tool:

SerperDevTool: A custom tool implemented using the SerperDev API for searching the internet, which aids the Researcher agent in gathering information.
Setup:

API Keys: The system uses environment variables to store API keys for the SerperDev tool and OpenAI.
Agent Configuration: Each agent is configured with specific roles, goals, and backstories to define their behavior and interactions.
Crew Assembly: The agents and their tasks are assembled into a crew to work together in a coordinated manner.
Task Definition:

Planner Task: Define how to structure the blog content.
Researcher Task: Gather information on the topic from the internet.
Writer Task: Create the written content based on the research.
Editor Task: Review and polish the content for final delivery.
